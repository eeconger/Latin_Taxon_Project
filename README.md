Hello!

This is a post to recognize the methods I used to extract data from a large database and search for extracted data within another list of data!
In short, I extracted Latin words (which are subunits in taxons) using regex, compiled this list into a Trie, and queried a list of Taxons for the occurences
of these Latin subunits. Can't wait to tackle the Greek subunits...
